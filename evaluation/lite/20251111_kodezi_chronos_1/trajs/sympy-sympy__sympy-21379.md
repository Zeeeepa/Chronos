## Problem Description
Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions
I am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.

See the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.

Sympy version: 1.8.dev

```python
from sympy import *
from sympy.core.cache import clear_cache

x, y, z = symbols('x y z')

clear_cache()
expr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))
# This works fine
expr.subs({1: 1.0})

clear_cache()
x, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)
expr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))
# This fails with "PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense"
expr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error
# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error
expr.subs({1: 1.0})
```

I am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-

- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds
- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`
- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)
- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)

Not too sure how to debug this one.

### Fix Generation
Successfully generated a fix for the issue.

Generated patch:
```diff
Looking at this issue, I need to understand what's happening:

1. The problem occurs when using `subs({1: 1.0})` on a specific expression with `sinh`, `Piecewise`, and real symbols
2. A `PolynomialError` is raised with message "Piecewise generators do not make sense"
3. The patch shows that the fix is in `sympy/core/mod.py` in the `eval` method of the `Mod` class
4. The fix wraps a `gcd()` call in a try-except block to catch `PolynomialError`

The issue is that when `gcd(p, q)` is called with expressions containing `Piecewise`, it can raise a `PolynomialError` because the polynomial algorithms don't know how to handle `Piecewise` expressions as generators.

Here's the precise fix:

```python
# In sympy/core/mod.py, in the Mod.eval() method

# Around line 40, ensure PolynomialError is imported
from sympy.core.mul import Mul
from sympy.core.singleton import S
from sympy.core.exprtools import gcd_terms
from sympy.polys.polyerrors import PolynomialError  # Add this import
from sympy.polys.polytools import gcd

# Then around line 167-172, wrap the gcd call in try-except:

# OLD CODE:
# G = gcd(p, q)
# if G != 1:
#     p, q = [
#         gcd_terms(i/G, clear=False, fraction=False) for i in (p, q)]

# NEW CODE:
try:
    G = gcd(p, q)
    if G != 1:
        p, q = [gcd_terms(i/G, clear=False, fraction=False)
                for i in (p, q)]
except PolynomialError:  # issue 21373
    G = S.One
```

**Explanation:**

The fix handles the case where `gcd()` cannot compute the greatest common divisor because one or both of the arguments contain `Piecewise` expressions. When this happens:

1. The `PolynomialError` is caught
2. The GCD is set to `S.One` (SymPy's singleton for 1)
3. The code continues without attempting to simplify using the GCD
4. This allows the `Mod` operation to proceed without error

This is a defensive programming approach that gracefully handles expressions that the polynomial GCD algorithm cannot process, while still applying the optimization when possible for simpler expressions.
