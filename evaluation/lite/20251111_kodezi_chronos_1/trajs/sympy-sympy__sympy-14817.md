```

The code shouldn't be using sympify to handle string arguments from MatrixSymbol.

I don't even understand what the code is doing. Why does it omit the `+` when the first argument is negative? This seems to assume that the arguments of MatAdd have a certain form, and that they will always print a certain way if they are negative.

### Fix Generation
Successfully generated a fix for the issue.

Generated patch:
```diff
Looking at this issue, I need to understand what's happening:

1. The code is trying to pretty print a `MatAdd` expression
2. When it encounters a `MatrixSymbol` with name `'y*'`, it tries to access `item.args[0]` which is the string `'y*'`
3. It then tries to sympify this string with `S('y*')`, which fails because `'y*'` is not valid Python syntax
4. The original patch tries to fix this by using `item.as_coeff_mmul()[0]` instead

Let me trace through the logic:
- The code is trying to determine if a term in a matrix addition is negative
- If negative, it omits the `+` sign (since the negative sign will be printed)
- The issue is that `item.args[0]` for a `MatrixSymbol` is just its name string, not a coefficient

The fix should:
1. Use `as_coeff_mmul()` to extract the actual coefficient from a matrix multiplication
2. Use the existing `_coeff_isneg()` helper function to check if it's negative
3. Handle the case where the coefficient might not be sympifiable

Here's the fix:

```python
def _print_MatAdd(self, expr):
    s = None
    for item in expr.args:
        pform = self._print(item)
        if s is None:
            s = pform     # First element
        else:
            coeff = item.as_coeff_mmul()[0]
            if _coeff_isneg(coeff):
                s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' '))
                pform = self._print(item)
            else:
                s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' + '))
        s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, pform))
    return s
```

The key changes from the original code:
1. Replace `S(item.args[0])` with `item.as_coeff_mmul()[0]` - this properly extracts the coefficient from a matrix expression
2. Use `_coeff_isneg(coeff)` instead of `_coeff_isneg(S(coeff))` - the coefficient is already a SymPy object from `as_coeff_mmul()`, so we don't need to sympify it again

This fix:
- Avoids trying to sympify string names from MatrixSymbol
- Properly extracts numeric coefficients from matrix multiplication terms
- Uses the existing helper function to check negativity
- Maintains the original logic of omitting `+` for negative terms
```
