## Problem Description
`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints
Description
	
I hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.
Setting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers ​rollback emulation. In practice, for each database:
BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()
TransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)
(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)
serialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.
deserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:

### Fix Generation
Successfully generated a fix for the issue.

Generated patch:
```diff
Looking at this issue, I need to fix the `deserialize_db_from_string` method in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` to handle foreign key constraints properly when restoring serialized data.

The problem is that when deserializing objects, if an object with a foreign key is saved before the object it references, it causes integrity errors. The solution is to:

1. Wrap the deserialization in a transaction
2. Disable constraint checks during deserialization (to handle forward references and cycles)
3. Re-enable and check constraints after all objects are loaded

Here's the fix:

```python
def deserialize_db_from_string(self, data):
    """
    Reload the database with data from a string generated by
    the serialize_db_to_string() method.
    """
    data = StringIO(data)
    # Load data in a transaction to handle forward references and cycles.
    with atomic(using=self.connection.alias):
        # Disable constraint checks, because some databases (MySQL) doesn't
        # support deferred checks.
        with self.connection.constraint_checks_disabled():
            for obj in serializers.deserialize('json', data, using=self.connection.alias):
                obj.save()
        # Manually check for any invalid keys that might have been added,
        # because constraint checks were disabled.
        self.connection.check_constraints()
```

And update the imports at the top of the file:

```python
from django.db.transaction import atomic
```

This solution:
- Uses `atomic()` to wrap everything in a transaction, ensuring atomicity
- Disables constraint checks during loading to allow objects to be saved in any order
- Re-enables and validates constraints after all objects are loaded
- Handles databases like MySQL that don't support deferred constraint checks
- Mirrors the approach used in Django's `loaddata` command

The fix ensures that serialized rollback in `TransactionTestCase` works correctly even when there are complex foreign key relationships between models.
```
