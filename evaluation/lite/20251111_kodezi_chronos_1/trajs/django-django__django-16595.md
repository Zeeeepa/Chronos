## Problem Description
Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField
Description
	
Let's consider the following operations: 
operations = [
	migrations.AddField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),
	),
]
If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:
optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books") 
[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]
Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. 
Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? 
Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like
		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
			operation
		):
			return [operation]

### Fix Generation
Successfully generated a fix for the issue.

Generated patch:
```diff
Looking at this issue, I need to fix the `AlterField.reduce()` method in Django's migration operations to handle the case where multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field can be reduced to just the last one.

## Analysis

The problem is that when there are multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations on the same field, they are not being reduced. The optimizer should recognize that only the final `AlterField` matters, as each subsequent `AlterField` overwrites the previous one.

The fix involves modifying the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class to check if the incoming operation is also an `AlterField` on the same field, and if so, return only the new operation (since it supersedes the current one).

## Solution

Here's the fix for `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`:

```python
def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
    if isinstance(
        operation, (AlterField, RemoveField)
    ) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation):
        return [operation]
    elif (
        isinstance(operation, RenameField)
        and self.is_same_field_operation(operation)
    ):
        return [
            operation,
            AlterField(
                model_name=self.model_name,
                name=operation.new_name,
                field=self.field,
            ),
        ]
    return super().reduce(operation, app_label)
```

## Explanation

The key change is on lines 2-4 where the `isinstance` check now includes both `AlterField` and `RemoveField` instead of just `RemoveField`.

**Why this works:**

1. **AlterField + AlterField**: When we have `AlterField(field=A)` followed by `AlterField(field=B)` on the same field, the first one is redundant. We only need the second one since it represents the final state. Returning `[operation]` means we keep only the newer `AlterField`.

2. **AlterField + RemoveField**: If an `AlterField` is followed by a `RemoveField` on the same field, the alter is pointless since the field gets removed anyway. We keep only the `RemoveField`.

3. **Same field check**: The `is_same_field_operation(operation)` method ensures we only reduce operations that affect the same model and field name.

This fix maintains backward compatibility and correctly optimizes migration operations by eliminating redundant intermediate `AlterField` operations.
```
