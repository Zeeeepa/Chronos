## Problem Description
Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels
Consider the following model:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
```

It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:

```python
>>> separability_matrix(cm)
array([[ True, False],
       [False,  True]])
```

If I make the model more complex:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True, False],
       [False, False, False,  True]])
```

The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.

If however, I nest these compound models:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
```
Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?

This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

### Fix Generation
Successfully generated a fix for the issue.

Generated patch:
```diff
Looking at this issue, I can see the problem clearly. The bug is in the `_cstack` function in the `separable.py` file.

## Problem Analysis

When stacking coordinate matrices horizontally (for the `&` operator in compound models), the function currently fills the bottom-right corner of the `cright` matrix with `1` instead of copying the actual values from the `right` matrix. This causes nested compound models to lose their separability information.

The issue is on this line:
```python
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1
```

When `right` is already a separability matrix (from a nested compound model like `cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)`), we need to preserve its structure, not just fill it with ones.

## The Fix

The patch correctly changes line 245 from:
```python
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1
```

to:
```python
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right
```

## Complete Fixed Function

Here's the corrected `_cstack` function:

```python
def _cstack(left, right):
    """
    Function corresponding to '&' operation.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : `~astropy.modeling.Model` or ndarray
        If input is of an array, it is the output of `coord_matrix`.

    Returns
    -------
    result : ndarray
        Result from this operation.
    """
    noutp = left.shape[0] + right.shape[0]
    
    if isinstance(left, Model):
        cleft = _coord_matrix(left, 'left', noutp)
    else:
        cleft = np.zeros((noutp, left.shape[1]))
        cleft[:left.shape[0], :left.shape[1]] = left
        
    if isinstance(right, Model):
        cright = _coord_matrix(right, 'right', noutp)
    else:
        cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right  # Fixed line
    
    return np.hstack([cleft, cright])
```

## Why This Fixes The Issue

When we have `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` where `cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)`:

1. The `cm` model already has a separability matrix that is diagonal (showing the two Linear1D models are independent)
2. When stacking with `Pix2Sky_TAN()`, the old code would replace `cm`'s separability matrix with all `1`s
3. This made it appear that the outputs were coupled when they weren't
4. The fix preserves the actual separability structure from `cm` by copying its matrix values instead of overwriting with `1`

This ensures that nested compound models maintain their correct separability information.
