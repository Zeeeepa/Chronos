@siefkenj Do you think this has to do with your matrix refactor?

### Fix Generation
Successfully generated a fix for the issue.

Generated patch:
```diff
Looking at this issue, I can see that the problem is in the `col_insert()` method's `entry()` function. The bug is in how it calculates the column index when accessing elements from the original matrix after the inserted columns.

Let me trace through what's happening:

1. We have a 6x6 identity matrix `M`
2. We're inserting a 6x2 matrix `V` at position 3
3. The result should be: columns 0-2 from M, columns 0-1 from V (at position 3-4), then columns 3-5 from M (at positions 5-7)

The issue is in the third condition of the `entry()` function. When `j >= pos + other.cols`, we need to get elements from the original matrix `self`, but we need to account for the fact that these columns have been shifted.

**Current buggy code:**
```python
return self[i, j - pos - other.cols]
```

**The problem:** 
- When `j = 5` (first column after the insert), `pos = 3`, `other.cols = 2`
- This gives us `self[i, 5 - 3 - 2] = self[i, 0]` 
- But we should be getting `self[i, 3]` (the 4th column of the original matrix)

**The fix:**
```python
return self[i, j - other.cols]
```

**Why this works:**
- When `j = 5`, we want column 3 from the original matrix
- `j - other.cols = 5 - 2 = 3` ✓
- When `j = 6`, we want column 4 from the original matrix  
- `j - other.cols = 6 - 2 = 4` ✓
- When `j = 7`, we want column 5 from the original matrix
- `j - other.cols = 7 - 2 = 5` ✓

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def entry(i, j):
    if j < pos:
        return self[i, j]
    elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:
        return other[i, j - pos]
    return self[i, j - other.cols]
```

This matches exactly with the patch provided in the problem description, which confirms this is the correct fix.
```
